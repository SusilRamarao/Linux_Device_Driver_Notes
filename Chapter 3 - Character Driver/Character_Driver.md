Well it has three main functions
1. driver_read()
2. driver_write()
3. driver_init() - > where we register the device driver as character driver

In the driver_init() -> we create file_operation instance where we attach the read and write function of file operation instance to our functions.

==Functions while writing a block of data==

`On x86 and x86-64, it simply does a direct read from the userspace address and write to the kernelspace address, while temporarily disabling SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention) if it is configured.`
